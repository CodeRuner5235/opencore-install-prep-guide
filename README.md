# opencore-install-prep-guide

This is NOT a guide on how to install opencore.
This guide is on how to partition and format your
drives to install macOS. MacOS is not like windows. 
It doesnt make the partitions that it needs. Instead,
it expacts them to be premade for it. If its not properly
partitioned, or the partitons are not the right size, or
in the right place, them macOS wont install. This is a 
video for you folks who need to see to understand how 
to do it.

Also,before you atempt this, BACK UP YOUR DATA.

What will be covered

1. How to install macOS on a drive with windows

2. How to install macOS on its own drive

Again, I am NOT showing you how to install opencore,
just how to prepare the drives for opencore
